# ðŸ§  **Nuanced Linguistic Analysis for Mental Health Text Categorization** ðŸ’¬

Welcome to the **Nuanced Linguistic Analysis for Mental Health Text Categorization** project! This repository showcases an advanced NLP approach to classify mental health-related text data by applying sophisticated linguistic analysis techniques. The goal is to identify mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress from textual data with a focus on the nuance and context of language. ðŸŒ¿

## ðŸš€ **Project Overview**

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to categorize text data with precision. It goes beyond simple keyword-based approaches by extracting **nuanced linguistic features** like sentiment, emotional tone, and syntactic structure to classify mental health issues. 

### **Key Features:**
- **Linguistic Feature Extraction**: Extracting advanced features like sentiment, emotion, word usage, and grammatical structures.
- **Multiclass Classification**: Categorizing text into mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and stress.
- **Context-Aware Classification**: Making predictions based on the subtle context of the language, avoiding oversimplification.
